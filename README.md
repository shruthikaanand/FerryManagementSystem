# FerryManagementSystem
Ferries provide vital connections which enable all types of journeys, whether that be local trips to work, study, visit others, or access amenities, or longer trips for business or tourism. Ferries also facilitate trade within and across national borders. The global ferry industry has a major impact on the economy and employment.

This project aims at building a simple ferry management system. The database will include information about ferry ride details, ticket details, passenger details, vehicle parking slots available and employee details and their role in the system.
